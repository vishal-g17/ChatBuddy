Advisory to Students Related to Mid-semester Exam

1.    Answer the questions in the order they appear in the question paper. Otherwise, one mark will be deducted.
2.    Mention the correct question number for each answer in the answer sheet.
3.    Write to the point answers. If an answer contains some relevant points and some irrelevant points, then it shows that the student does not understand the concept. No mark will be given in such a case.
4.    Listing points in the answer is not enough. The points have to be explained. Ideally, the answer of a 5-mark question should be of 2 to 3 pages.
5.    The handwriting should be readable. Otherwise, the answers will not be checked.
6.    Answers to theoretical questions will be marked on the basis of the points and explanation.
7.    If there is any numerical question, then show all the steps of the calculation.
8.    If any question requires drawing a diagram, then the diagram should be drawn neatly.
9.    Do not use unfair means. The exam system of the university is strict. I will not be able to help if any student gets caught.

Lab Programs
1)Binary search using array ,input from user, also calculate position of that number
2) implement Insertion Sort and Bubble Sort
3)Sort a given set of elements using the quick sort method and determine the time required to sort the elements. Repeat The Experiment For Different values of n(the number of elements in the list to be sorted).The elements can be read from a file or can be generated using the random number generator. Sorting result in table form , particular comparisons and number of swaps.
4) Create an empty Red-Black Tree. Insert a series of elements into the tree, one at a time, while adhering to Red-Black Tree insertion rules. After each insertion, print the tree's structure
5) Implement Radix Sort and Bucket Sort algorithms and compare their performance on a set of randomly generated integers.
6 A) Obtain the Topological ordering of vertices in a given digraph
B)Compute the transitive closure of a given directed graph using Warshall algorithm
7) Implement 0/1 Knapsack problem using Dynamic 
Programming.
8) From a given vertex in a weighted connected graph, find 
shortest paths to other vertices using Dijikstra’s 
algorithm
9) Find Minimum Cost Spanning Tree of a given 
undirected graph using Kruskal’s algorithm.
 10 A) Print all the nodes reachable from a given starting 
node in a digraph using BFS method.

11/04/24, 8:14 pm - Lakshay Rao Nsut Mac: Good evening everyone.
This is a humble request from my side to everyone here in the class ki please 3 semesters ja chuke hain , 4th chal rha hai ...Please stop tampering with your answer sheets . Aisa krne se puri class me kuch bacho ki CGPA hike kr rhi hai aur majority ki neeche chli gayi hai aur iss sbke karan average khrb ho chuki hai . Humse se ek aage wala batch dekhlo ya koi aur branch utha ke dekhlo . Dusri branch ke kafi bacho ki cgpa is what they deserve and yaha pe what is happening is ki jitni bnde deserve krte hain usse 1 kam pointer hi aa rha hai aur jo deserve nahi krte unke marks spike kre hi ja rahe hain.... Iss sb reason ke karan peeps have been blocking opportunities for others ..jaise abhi recent me JPMC wale hackathon me only few people from our class were allowed . To dosti -yaari me ye chindi harkatein krna aur support krna bnd krdo and i would request sbse class me ki kahi bhi tampering dikhe dont stop and report aage badh ke respective teacher ko ...nahi to dosti me aise krte reh jana aur placements tampering wale hi le jayange . Aur agr tampering krne wale bndo ko sch me lagta hai vo intelligent hain to common - grounds pe aake bina tampering ke check kro apne aap ko ... sb pta chl jaega ...at the end of the day ..it's a full circle ..those go up must come down .....
Peace ☮️
11/04/24, 8:20 pm - Lakshay Rao Nsut Mac: Sb ek doosre ko support kro aur aage badho ...ek - do bnde akele kitna hi aage jaoge ...Life me clg se bhar bhi niklna hai ...bhar bhi yehi log kahi na kahi milenge ..Selfish reh ke aur lalchi reh ke nahi ja paoge kafi aage .....

01/05/24, 9:53 pm - Lakshay Rao Nsut Mac: Hi everyone,
I think ab tak sabko smjh aa gya hoga ki is semester kaafi chize khrab hui h class me academically. Kuch gltiya proffs ki side se or kuch gltiya students ki side se bhi.
I didn't want to get into it bar bar but since majority class ke sath mera bhi nuksaan ho rha h cgpa ka, I think I should take a stand. 
Also kaafi baccho ne mujhe at times bola h I should appear again for the cr thingy and manage things. 
Sabne dekha h the way I worked for three semesters, so I hope aapko pta hi hoga how would I manage. Also yes is sem jo new issues appear hue h, usko bhi tackle krungi.
Baki it's class ka decision, all upto you guys. 
Hence, incase you feel dubara cr elections hone chahiye, toh apna opinion dena.
Probably we can have offline voting on 3rd may practical itself ya whatsapp poll ya jo bhi method thik lage sbko.
Incase you all are fine with the current scenario, I'll also co-operate hence no voting required. 
Thanks

As your potential class representative, I want to assure you that I am deeply committed to serving our class with integrity, enthusiasm, and dedication. I believe that strong leadership begins with listening, and I am here to listen to each and every one of your voices.

Throughout my time here, I have had the privilege of getting to know many of you, and I understand the diverse needs and aspirations of our class. I am passionate about representing all of you and advocating for initiatives that benefit each and every student.

If elected, I will work tirelessly to ensure that our class is a welcoming and inclusive community where everyone feels valued and respected. I will be a strong voice for our concerns and ideas, and I will work collaboratively with both students and faculty to address any issues that arise.

Additionally, I am committed to organizing fun and engaging events that bring us together as a class. From social gatherings to academic workshops to community service projects, I believe that these activities are essential for fostering a sense of belonging and camaraderie among us all.

Ultimately, my goal is to make our time here as memorable and fulfilling as possible. I want to empower each and every one of you to thrive academically, socially, and personally.

In conclusion, I am asking for your trust and support in this election. Together, we can make our class the best it can be and create lasting memories that we will cherish for years to come.

16/06/24, 11:54 am - Aman Ashiwal Mac 🙂: Thoda ye course registration ka clear kr deta hu.
A) for students with no improvement/backlogs.
They have 2 options 
24 credits and 28 credits
24 credits= 4core+1ED(most preferred out of 3 courses)+EO(one from any pool)
28 credits= same as above +1EG
Toh EG ka seen ye hai ki isme 2 options:
1. Offline: isme b 2 case 
    Case 1: agar class me 60+ bachhe 28 credits opt krte h offline toh jo ED ke 3 subjects ki choice thi usme se 2nd preference vala allot ho jayega.
Case 2: Agar required strength nahi banti to jis bachhe ne offline ke liye opt Kiya tha usko dusri branch ka EG allot ho jayega aur kis branch ka allot hoga vo University decide kregi.
2. Online: isme 5 subject ki list h usme se ek choose kro. NSUT id se usme register kro aur make sure ki jo course choose Kiya h uski exam date EO ke exam date se clash na ho rhi ho.
B) students with 1 improvement/backlog:
Unke liye recommend hai ki 24+4 credits ke liye jaye aur ek improvement vala subject de.
Agar 7 subjects jyada lag rhe h to dusre combination try kr skte ho.
Agar isse jyda backlog/ improvement hai aur es sem hi clear krni h to phr ED next sem krna pdega (recommended: backlogs ko semester wise evenly distribute kro ek baar me jyda pressure lene se achha h)

Choice filling steps: 
1. You have to select all the choices available in EO, do not leave anything blank.
2. The subjects you choose to study in sem 5 are to be given 1st preference, uske bad give whatever preference to other subjects. For example: Psychology of Learning ko 1st preference do and baki ko any. 
3. Same applies to ED as well, optimization ko 1st preference baki kuch bhi.
4. The people who don't want 2nd ed/eg, and usko fill up kiye bina form submit nhi ho rha, don't worry tum bas preference dal do, Pre-qualifier google form me jo fill kia tha usse match krenge wo log, 2nd ed nhi lia h toh nhi hi milega.

i'd like you all to request mam to take a few extra classes (i don't wanna impose my decision isliye need class support), so that syllabus  speeds up and we could give an "extra ct" 
reason: if extra ct takes place, best scored ones would be taken into account, so win-win situation for all.

I am enclosing the list of students whose enrollment status is completed and, has been shared by NPTEL (as of 2nd Jan).  Those whose names are not present in the enclosed list are advised to enroll on NPTEL as soon as possible. However, those who have already enrolled and still couldn't find their name, are requested to edit their profile (Steps Enclosed).

Points to Remember while Enrolling/Editing Profile on Swayam NPTEL:

• Your Enrollment Email ID should be NSUT email ID. (@nsut.ac.in)
• Your Name should be as per University Records.
• Students must select "Yes" in the NPTEL Local Chapter.
• The correct Name of the college should be selected from the dropdown. (Do not select "Others" and write NSUT, this will not be considered. Search for "Netaji Subhas University of Technology" from the Dropdown.)
• The Roll Number must be ensured that it is correct.
• Update the ABC ID with the one that you have recently created, Click "Allow Swayam to Create" in case you do not have one.
• Check the screenshot below for further details.

Those students whose names are highlighted in Red have enrolled with their Personal Email IDs. Such students must enroll again using their University Email (@nsut.ac.in).
