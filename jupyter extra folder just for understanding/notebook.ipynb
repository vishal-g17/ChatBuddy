      "This is a humble request from my side to everyone here in the class ki please 3 semesters ja chuke hain , 4th chal rha hai ...Please stop tampering with your answer sheets . Aisa krne se puri class me kuch bacho ki CGPA hike kr rhi hai aur majority ki neeche chli gayi hai aur iss sbke karan average khrb ho chuki hai . Humse se ek aage wala batch dekhlo ya koi aur branch utha ke dekhlo . Dusri branch ke kafi bacho ki cgpa is what they deserve and yaha pe what is happening is ki jitni bnde deserve krte hain usse 1 kam pointer hi aa rha hai aur jo deserve nahi krte unke marks spike kre hi ja rahe hain.... Iss sb reason ke karan peeps have been blocking opportunities for others ..jaise abhi recent me JPMC wale hackathon me only few people from our class were allowed . To dosti -yaari me ye chindi harkatein krna aur support krna bnd krdo and i would request sbse class me ki kahi bhi tampering dikhe dont stop and report aage badh ke respective teacher ko ...nahi to dosti me aise krte reh jana aur placements tampering wale hi le jayange . Aur agr tampering krne wale bndo ko sch me lagta hai vo intelligent hain to common - grounds pe aake bina tampering ke check kro apne aap ko ... sb pta chl jaega ...at the end of the day ..it's a full circle ..those go up must come down .....\n",

Otherwise, one mark will be deducted.\\n2.    Mention the correct question number for each answer in the answer sheet.\\n3.    Write to the point answers. If an answer contains some relevant points and some irrelevant points, then it shows that the student does not understand the concept. No mark will be given in such a case.\\n4.    Listing points in the answer is not enough. The points have to be explained. Ideally, the answer of a 5-mark question should be of 2 to 3 pages.\\n5.    The handwriting should be readable. Otherwise, the answers will not be checked.\\n6.    Answers to theoretical questions will be marked on the basis of the points and explanation.\\n7.    If there is any numerical question, then show all the steps of the calculation.\\n8.    If any question requires drawing a diagram, then the diagram should be drawn neatly.\\n9.    Do not use unfair means. The exam system of the university is strict. I will not be able to help if any student gets caught.\\n',\n",
